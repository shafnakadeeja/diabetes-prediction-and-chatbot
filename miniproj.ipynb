        "        There are three main types: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin.\n",
        "        Type 2 diabetes is the most common type, where the body either doesn't use insulin effectively or doesn't produce enough.\n",
        "        Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy but usually goes away after childbirth.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Treatment options vary depending on the type and severity of diabetes. They may include:\n",
        "        * Medication (oral medications or injectable insulin)\n",
        "        * Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight management)\n",
        "        * Blood sugar monitoring\n",
        "\n",
        "        Diet: Aim for a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats.\n",
        "        Exercise: Regular physical activity helps manage blood sugar levels and improve overall health.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Blood Sugar Monitoring: Regularly checking your blood sugar levels helps you understand how your body responds to food, activity, and medication.\n",

        "        Risk Factors: Some common risk factors for developing diabetes include family history, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Complications: Diabetes can lead to various complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, foot problems, and eye problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Prevention Measures: Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption can help prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Precautions During Pregnancy: Pregnant women with diabetes need to carefully monitor their blood sugar levels and follow a specialized meal plan to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby.\n",

        "        Lifestyle Changes: Adopting healthy lifestyle habits can significantly improve diabetes management and reduce the risk of complications.\n",

        "        Long-Term Effects: Untreated or poorly managed diabetes can lead to serious long-term effects on various organs and systems in the body.\n",

        "        Diabetes in Children: Type 1 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes in children, although type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly prevalent due to rising obesity rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Attributes:\n",
        "        * Glucose Level: Normal fasting blood sugar levels typically range from 70 to 100 mg/dL. Levels above 126 mg/dL may indicate diabetes.\n",
        "        * Blood Pressure: Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg. High blood pressure is a risk factor for diabetes complications.\n",
        "        * Cholesterol and Triglycerides: Healthy cholesterol levels include total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL, LDL (bad) cholesterol below 100 mg/dL, HDL (good) cholesterol above 40 mg/dL for men and above 50 mg/dL for women, and triglycerides below 150 mg/dL.\n",
        "        * HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin): This blood test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. An HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes.\n",
        "        * Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. In diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin (type 1) or it becomes resistant to insulin (type 2).\n",
        "        * BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal, while a BMI of 30 or higher indicates obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\n",
        "        * Diabetes Pedigree Function: This function assesses the probability of diabetes based on family history.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Research and New Developments: Ongoing research aims to improve diabetes management and develop new treatments, including artificial pancreas systems, gene therapy, and stem cell transplantation.\n",
