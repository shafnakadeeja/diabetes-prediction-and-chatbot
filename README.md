Diabetes Prediction and Chatbot

This project is an interactive application built using Streamlit that integrates two key components:

1. *Diabetes Prediction*: A machine learning model that predicts whether a user is diabetic based on input data.
2. *Diabetes Chatbot*: A chatbot based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that can answer diabetes-related questions by extracting relevant information from a provided context.

## Features

- *Diabetes Prediction*: Uses an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict diabetes based on user input.
- *Diabetes Chatbot*: Implements a BERT-based chatbot to answer user questions on diabetes, such as symptoms, treatment options, risk factors, and more.
- *Metrics*: Provides model accuracy and F1 score on the test set.

Technologies Used:

- *Streamlit*: To build the interactive UI.
- *TensorFlow/Keras*: For building the LSTM model to predict diabetes.
- *PyTorch*: For implementing the BERT-based chatbot.
- *Scikit-learn*: For data processing, train-test split, and model evaluation.
- *Pandas and Numpy*: For data manipulation and numerical computation.
- *Transformers (Hugging Face)*: For utilizing BERT model for question-answering tasks.

How to Run the Project:

1. *Clone the repository*:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-chatbot.git
    cd diabetes-prediction-chatbot
    

2. *Install the required dependencies*:

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary packages by running:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

    The requirements.txt should include the following dependencies:
    - streamlit
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - tensorflow
    - torch
    - transformers

3. *Prepare the dataset*:

    Download the [Diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and ensure it is stored as diabetes.csv in the root directory of the project.

4. *Run the Streamlit app*:

    Start the Streamlit application by running the following command:

    bash
    streamlit run app.py
    

    This will launch the web app, where you can input data for diabetes prediction and interact with the diabetes chatbot.

## Diabetes Prediction

 User Inputs:

The model takes in the following inputs for prediction:

- *Pregnancies*: Number of pregnancies.
- *Glucose*: Plasma glucose concentration.
- *Blood Pressure*: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- *Skin Thickness*: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- *Insulin*: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- *BMI*: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- *Diabetes Pedigree Function*: Diabetes pedigree function, which assesses the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- *Age*: The person's age.

The model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not based on the input values.

Model:

An LSTM-based deep learning model is used for diabetes prediction. The model architecture includes three LSTM layers with Dropout layers for regularization.

Metrics:

The following metrics are provided:

- *Accuracy*: Measures the model's accuracy on the test data.
- *F1 Score*: Evaluates the balance between precision and recall.

Diabetes Chatbot:

The chatbot uses a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset to answer questions related to diabetes. The context includes general information about diabetes symptoms, treatment, risk factors, and lifestyle management.

Usage:

Type in a question in the chatbot section of the sidebar, and the bot will provide an answer based on the context.

Future Improvements:

- *Advanced Diabetes Prediction*: Consider incorporating additional data or advanced models to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Fine-tuning the Chatbot*: Fine-tune the BERT model on a specific medical Q&A dataset to improve the chatbot's accuracy and relevance.
- *Real-time API Integration*: Integrate with a real-time diabetes API for more dynamic answers to health-related queries.
